# FastAPI Learning

I prefer to create a virtual environment but that is up to you.

> python -m virtualenv fastapi_env

Install it with all the optional dependencies and features using `[all]`.
Installs `uvicorn` too.

> pip install fastapi[all]

`uvicorn` server up with the name of our filename, app and reload on change!

> uvicorn [filename]:app --reload

_This is a basic setup as they teach on their site._
